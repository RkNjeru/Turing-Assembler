Dr. Eades, 

This project would be best ran on a Windows machine using Visual Studio 2015. 
Place the "Proj2" folder on the C drive. Such that the file path for the folder would be C:\Proj2\
Place all .TM files for the assembler to read in the "Proj2" folder.Such that the file path for the .TM file would be C:\Proj2\example.TM
To run the project, once the Project folder is in the C drive, open the .sln file in the "Proj2" folder and start the Project.
When giving the file path, simply give the name of the file, as long as it is in the C:\Proj2\ folder. 

Best,
Roy
