# Turing-Assembler

## Synopsis

At the top of the file there should be a short introduction and/ or overview that explains what the project is.
This description should match descriptions added for package managers (Gemspec, package.json, etc.)

An assembly language is a low-level programming language for programming computational devices. A low-level programming language is
one that has a tight correspondence with the hardware of the machine. In this project I developed an assembly language for
Turing Machines. 

The input of the program is a TM (Turing Machine) source file, which contains the initialization and algorithm for the 
Turing machine. Then the program will compile the instructions and will take in a word and test it for acceptance with 
respect to the TM defined in the source file. As the program executes the turing machine, the complete trace of the machine
will be displayed. 

## Code Example

An example of the TM source file and more further instructions are located in TM_Project_Problem.pdf.

## Motivation

This project was created with great enthusiasm for Dr. Harley Eades' Theory of Computation class at Augusta University. 

## Installation

Right now, the application is in raw code and will need to be opened, compiled and run using Visual Studio. I will 
be adding an executable program shortly. 

## Tests

An example of the input and trace of the above TM is located in the TM_Project_Problem.pdf. 

## Contributors

Special thanks to Dr. Harley Eades.
